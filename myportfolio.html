    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Oteri Nyamari Edmond, a web developer with a unique background in accounting and economics. Despite being new to programming, I've found that my analytical skills and attention to detail have been valuable in this field and getting myself into programming might get me a new skillset. I'm currently skilled in HTML, CSS, and I'm eager to expand my knowledge in JavaScript, Python, and other technologies. My goal is to leverage my diverse background to create websites that are not only visually appealing, but also user-friendly, responsive, and optimized for business needs.</p>
